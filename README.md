# Restaurant Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing restaurant data from Zomato's Bangalore dataset to derive insights on ratings, cuisine preferences, cost distribution, and more. The workflow includes data cleaning in Python, SQL queries for deeper exploration, Excel dashboards for visualization, and statistical analysis to validate key hypotheses.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Cleaning (Python)
- Standardize cuisine names (handle multiple cuisines per restaurant).
- Handle missing rating values and standardize cost fields.
- Ensure data consistency and remove duplicates.

### 2. SQL Queries
- Classify restaurants by **cuisine type, average cost, and location**.
- Identify **most reviewed** and **highest-rated** areas.
- Analyze popular cuisine combinations.

### 3. Excel Visualization
- Pivot charts to display **cost vs. rating**.
- Location-wise distribution of restaurants and their average ratings.
- Approximate footfall analysis based on **votes or reviews**.

### 4. Statistical Insight
- **Hypothesis:** "Restaurants offering North Indian + Chinese cuisine are rated higher on average than single-cuisine restaurants."
- Perform a **t-test** or **ANOVA** on restaurant ratings.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning.
- **SQL** for querying restaurant trends.
- **Excel** for visualization and trend analysis.
- **Statistical methods** (t-test, ANOVA) for hypothesis testing.

## Expected Outcomes
- Identification of top-rated restaurant locations and cuisine trends.
- Insights into how cost influences ratings.
- Data-driven conclusions on the impact of multi-cuisine offerings on ratings.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Data Cleaning**: Run the Python script to preprocess the dataset.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Use the provided SQL queries to extract insights.
3. **Excel Visualization**: Load the cleaned data into Excel and create pivot charts.
4. **Statistical Testing**: Conduct hypothesis testing using Python or Excel.
